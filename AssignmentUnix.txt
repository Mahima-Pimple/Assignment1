46) Is linux a case-sensitive operating system?

Solution : yes, In linux all command should be in lower case. Linux treats capital letters and lower case letters as different characters. Linux is developed using c language and c language is case sensitive.

Ls: command not found
mahima@mahima-VirtualBox:~$ 

50) Display your currently logged in user

114) How we see all env variables in alphabical order?

Solution : 
use this command from any location: get-childitem env:*

122) Difference between Local/Shell variables to Global Variable

Solution : 
Local Variables : Local variables are declared inside the function. Local variables are created when the function has started 
execution and is lost when the function terminates,
Global Variables : Global variables are declared outside the function. Global variable is created as execution starts 
and is lost when the program ends.

130) What is Globbing? Explain in depth with examples?
Solution : The Bash shell feature that is used for matching or expanding specific types
of patterns is called globbing.
Globbing is mainly used to match filenames or searching for content in a file.

140) What is Quoting? and Why do we need it?

3)vi <filename>
This command creates a new file and open that file into vi editor.

The difference of all commands are 
In cat command file is created and we can write some text into that after creating file which can be seen by 
cat <filename>. In touch command empty file is created.
